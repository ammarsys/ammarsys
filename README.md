Hi ðŸ‘‹

I am a Python developer. While Python is my specialty, I also work with SQL, JS, HTML & CSS and C. On a daily basis, I work with APIs, CLIs, API wrappers of whatever piques my interest. You can find my personal site [here](https://novu.pythonanywhere.com/) and you can contact me via my [private Discord server](https://discord.gg/MnAfrSnAXd). I've been programming for 3 years so far.

Over the years of programming I've achieved substancial success in Python, my most notable project is [pyaww](https://github.com/novusys/pyaww).
