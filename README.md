Hi ðŸ‘‹

Your local developer here. While Python is my specialty, I also work with SQL, JS, HTML & CSS and C. On a daily basis, I work with APIs, CLIs, API wrappers, microcontroollers or whatever piques my interest. You can find my personal site [here](https://novu.pythonanywhere.com/) and you can contact me via my Discord - novu#7568. I've been programming for 3 years so far. In future I want to improve my C and SQL skills.

Over the years of programming I've achieved substancial success in Python, my most notable project being [pyaww](https://github.com/novusys/pyaww).
